# Mission-to-Mars
#Overview
Our goal was to build an app to scrape data from a mars database to help promote our mission to Mars project.
#Results
We were able to pull all of the hemispheres and their titles to our web app and have them displayed in an appropriate manner. Along with the photos we also included quick facts about Mars and recent featured photo of Mar's surface. <br>

Along with being able to view on all platforms we made adjustments to: Bolding the font, change the table to floating and rounding our pictures off for more visual appeal.
